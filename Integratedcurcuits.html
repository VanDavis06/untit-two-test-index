    An integrated circuit is a small chip of a semiconductor material that contains electronic components and their interconnections123. It is also called a microchip or a chip12. An integrated circuit eliminates the need for several components such as transistors, resistors, diodes, capacitors, and wires by using silicon and soldering24. An integrated circuit is much smaller and faster than a standard circuit3.
